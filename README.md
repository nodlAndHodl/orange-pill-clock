Thanks for checking this out

## Board Used 
Arduino R4 Uno / FreeNove V5 Rev4 Wifi (I found the FreeNove a bit cheaper on Amazon)

## OLED Used
0.91 inch display 128 * 32 pixel display with the SCL/SDA pins
(I am going to look into some larger displays etc. Might condense some of these into one view like the dollar value and market cap for example)

## Connections 
OLED GND => GND board
OLED VCC => 5V board
OLED SCL => SCL board
OLED SDA => SDA board

## Notes
This was my first time working with an OLED so some of that felt a bit hacky. Feel free to open an issue up in GH if need. I would like to do a larger LED display (think large format clock) but would like to iterate on this with a slightly larger OLED as a screen and 3D print off some cases. Another thing I am thinking I will do is use some of the smaller Arduino Nano's to do this with. THe board I chose was bit larger than necessary but has the cool led array for writing out stuff. Might keep that for other things. I'd like to something with python too, so I might rewrite this into that, as I am not a huge fan of the arduino IDE and the VsCode extension seems to have lost support and felt hacky. 

## Contributions 
Are definitely welcome. Please submit issues, PR's etc. I am totally open to ideas. I am not sure where this will go, but this was a fun project over a day or so to tinker with microcontrollers again.
